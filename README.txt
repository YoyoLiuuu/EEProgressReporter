This was created locally the spring of 2022, and uploaded to Github 5/30/2023. 

Original README document: 

1. Unzip folder
2. Open Visual Studio Code
3. From File -> Open Folder, open the whole folder (Open EEProgressReporter Folder, which contains three folders inside: Extra, env, and EEProgressReporter)
4. Open terminal
5. Select Git Bash (note: ONLY Git Bash terminal will be able to run the code properly) 
5. Type "cd ~(current location)/EEProgressReporter" to go to the smaller EEProgressReporter folder. For me, the command is "cd ~/OneDrive/Desktop/EEProgressReporter/EEProgressReporter"
6. Type "python3 main.py" to run the program. Click on the link provided to access the website. 

Thank you so much! Have a nice day.
